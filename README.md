### 1 Business Context and Problem Background 

In the e-commerce industry, customer churn is one of the most critical business challenges, as it directly impacts revenue, marketing costs, and the long-term sustainability of company growth. Customer churn refers to the condition in which customers stop making transactions or are no longer actively using the service within a certain period.

For e-commerce companies, losing customers not only means a reduction in future revenue potential but also leads to higher customer acquisition costs, which are generally far more expensive than retaining existing customers. Moreover, a high churn rate can indicate a misalignment between the services offered, customer experience, and market expectations.

Based on the analyzed business conditions, the company experiences a customer churn rate of 16%. This means that out of every 100 customers, 16 stop making transactions. Within the context of the e-commerce industry, this figure deserves serious attention. Although it is not considered extreme, a churn rate above 10% signals a gradual erosion of the customer base if no proper intervention is implemented. If left unaddressed, this situation may hinder long-term growth and weaken the company’s competitive position.

Therefore, the company must understand the factors that influence customers’ decisions to remain loyal or leave the platform, particularly those related to transaction behavior, loyalty, and customer experience. With this understanding, the company can design more targeted, efficient, and data-driven retention strategies, enabling sustainable churn reduction over time.
