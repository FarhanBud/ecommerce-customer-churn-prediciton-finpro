## Project Overview

Customer churn presents a significant challenge in the e-commerce sector, directly impacting revenue stability and increasing operational costs due to the high expense of acquiring new customers compared to retaining existing ones. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn, thereby enabling proactive retention strategies.

The analysis follows a comprehensive end-to-end data science workflow, including data cleaning, rigorous preprocessing to prevent data leakage, handling class imbalance, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Business Context and Objective

### Problem Statement
<img width="613" alt="Churn Context Illustration" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d9daa6d-9dd1-49d0-90c3-25e8b87856e5">

The company is currently experiencing a customer churn rate of approximately **16.8%**. The lack of a predictive mechanism results in a reactive approach to customer retention, leading to inefficient marketing spend and lost revenue opportunities.

### Objectives
1.  **Predictive Modeling:** Develop a binary classification model to identify customers at high risk of churn.
2.  **Metric Optimization:** Prioritize **Recall** to minimize False Negatives (identifying as many potential churners as possible).
3.  **Business Insight:** Analyze feature importance to understand key drivers of customer attrition.

## Analytical Approach

To ensure model validity and performance, the following methodology was applied:

1.  **Data Quality & Leakage Prevention:**
    - Removed lagging indicators (e.g., `DaySinceLastOrder`) to prevent look-ahead bias and data leakage.
    - Standardized categorical values to reduce dimensionality and improve consistency.

2.  **Preprocessing Pipeline:**
    - **Data Splitting:** Applied stratified sampling to maintain class distribution in training and testing sets.
    - **Imputation:** Implemented median and mode imputation within a pipeline to prevent statistical leakage from the test set.
    - **Scaling & Encoding:** Utilized StandardScaler for distance-based algorithms and OneHotEncoder for categorical variables.

3.  **Handling Class Imbalance:**
    - Integrated SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) within the cross-validation process to address the minority class (churners) without overfitting.

4.  **Model Selection:**
    - Benchmarked multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and XGBoost.
    - Selected the optimal model based on Recall performance on the validation set.

## Key Results

### Final Model Performance
The **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm was selected as the final model after hyperparameter tuning.

-   **Hyperparameters:** `n_neighbors=11`, `weights='distance'`, `metric='euclidean'`
-   **Recall (Test Set):** ~91%
-   **Interpretation:** The model successfully identifies approximately **91%** of customers who are actually at risk of churning. This high recall ensures that retention efforts cover the vast majority of at-risk customers.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

### Technical Conclusion
Based on the evaluation results on the Test Set, the project concludes the following:
1.  **Best Model:** KNN was selected as the best-performing model due to its high sensitivity to minority class patterns.
2.  **Metric Performance:** The model achieved a Recall score of ~91% on the Churn class.
3.  **Risk Mitigation:** The False Negative rate is very low, ensuring that the business does not miss the opportunity to retain at-risk customers.

### Business Impact Analysis
Using a simulation with 10,000 customers and a 16.8% churn rate:
* **Reactive Approach (Without Model):** Estimated loss of ~$84,000 due to undetected churn.
* **Proactive Approach (With Model):** Total cost reduced to ~$22,840 (Retention Cost + Remaining Loss).
* **Potential Savings:** ~$61,160 (saving approximately 73% of churn-associated costs).

### Strategic Recommendations
1.  **Focus on the "Golden Period":** Churn risk is highest at low Tenure (new customers). Create a special Onboarding Program for the first 3 months.
2.  **Improve Complaint Mechanism:** Customers who file a Complaint have a high tendency to churn. Implement a priority handling system ("Service Recovery Paradox").
3.  **Optimize Mobile App:** Users who rarely open the app (low `HourSpendOnApp`) are at risk. Use personalized push notifications to re-engage inactive users.

## Model Deployment

The final model has been deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit to facilitate real-time prediction for business stakeholders.
